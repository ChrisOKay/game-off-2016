# Amano-Iwato
*The search for the sun goddess*

## Prologue

3000 years after the last vanishing of Amaterasu, the goddess of light, history repeats itself: Amaterasu fleed in her cave again, leaving the earth in complete darkness. You were chosen by the gods to find and assemble the five sacred lights, lure Amaterasu out of her cave and bring the sun back to earth.

To achieve this, you have to overcome her brother Susano'o, the god of storm, and his minions. Susano'o, who was responsible for Amaterasus first disappearance and was therefore banished from Heaven, embraces the darkness and is dedicated to keep his sister locked away forever.

Susano'o got hold of the five lights and hid all of them in the city of Tokyo, well protected by his loyal minions.

Will you be able to defeat his forces, assemble all lights and bring the sun back to earth?

## Chapter 1 - Roppongi-eki

After a lucid dream brought to you by the gods to outline your mission, you wake up in your room. There's not much you can see or do, but light is shining through the only door of the room. There's a map on the wall, and the light coming from the door is illuminating the target of you first mission: "Roppongi-eki" - the deepest subway station in Tokyo. To find the first light, you need to descend to the Tokyo underworld.

## Chapter 2 - Sumidagawa Fireworks Festival

After discovering the first of the sacred lights in the Tokyo underground and stealing it back from Susano'os daughter Suseribime, you head back to your home to contact the gods for the next hint. They tell you that Susano'o is furious about your first success and now plans to destroy one of the lights in a spectacular explosion at the Sumidagawa Fireworks Festival to demonstrate his power. You need to stop him!
